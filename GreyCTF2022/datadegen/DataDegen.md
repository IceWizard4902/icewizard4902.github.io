# Data Degeneration

This is a relatively simple challenge. The data in the `data.txt` is generated by doing samples on three normal distributions of unknown mean and standard deviation of `1`.

We can plot all the values in the `data.txt` on a graph and observe the trend in the values. I sort them in ascending order so I can have a better visualisation of the value in the graph. The script for plotting is the commented out code in the `solve.py` file. Running the code gave us this graph.

We can clearly see the three groups of values on the graph, which most likely corresponds to the three different mean values used to sample them. Since the standard deviation is `1`, the difference in consecutive sorted values in each group should not be greater than `1`. The groups are more than `1` value apart, hence we can use this information to sort out the values in three groups, then calculate the mean value. Submitting the three mean values calculated should give us the flag.

Solution Implementation: 

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np 

file1 = open('data.txt', 'r')
lines = file1.readlines()

arr = lines[0].split(", ")
num_arr = []

for i in arr:
	num_arr.append(float(i))

num_arr = sorted(num_arr)
index = [i for i in range(800)]
num_arr = np.array(num_arr)
# plt.scatter(index, num_arr)
# plt.show()

batch = [list() for i in range(3)]

current = num_arr[0]
batch_no = 0
for num in num_arr:
	if (num - current) >= 1:
		batch_no += 1 
	batch[batch_no].append(num)
	current = num 

for i in range(3):
	print(np.mean(batch[i]))
```
