# PicoCTF

I think the site is famous among the people in this field already, so no introduction is really needed. With the guidance of [Daniel from NUS Greyhats](https://twitter.com/daniellimws), I tried this platform for a week to grind some web challenges.

Unfortunately there is no writeups, simply because I grinded in the [PicoCTF Gym](https://picoctf.org/get_started.html) for the web challenges only. Also, there is a GREAT source for the writeups, in the [Martin Carlisle Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@carlislemc/videos). I watched the videos for the challenges I failed to solve.

In any case, here is my [profile](https://play.picoctf.org/users/EdelweissV) showing the 37 (web) challenges I solved.
