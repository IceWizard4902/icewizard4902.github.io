# ISITDTU 2022

My first non-NUS CTF! I was mostly carried by the insane people @ [NUS Greyhats](https://nusgreyhats.org/). I did manage to contribute something though, the Welcome challenge (which is to find the flag hidden in the emotes on the ISITDTU CTF Discord server), a OSINT and Misc challenge.

For the finals, I managed to solve one crypto challenge using the techniques from my writeups in the Cryptohack journey.
